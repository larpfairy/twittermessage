Michael Gibbons Comp 330 Software Engineering Project 1

This project provides the code base and classes which we will utilize to create a twitter scraper app.
It includes a Tweet class and a separate class for Junit Tests. The Tweet class has methods to handle both parsing and storing the parsed tweet into its appropiate ArrayLists.
